  "readme": "# What this thing does\n\nThis is a scaffold for responding to [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks). \n\nBy default it'll send some emails to customers for you. But you can reprogram it to do whatever, plotting world domination or something else.\n\nThere is no user interface in stripe-webhook-server - use [Stripe's website](https://stripe.com).\n\n# Nickname\n\nI get tired of typing `stripe-webhook-server` so it'll be referred to as `SWS`. It is not affiliated with the Swiss, Swiss cheese, Swiss army knives, etc. but pronouncing it 'swiss' is cool.\n\n# Assumptions\n\n- You have a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account.\n- You're running [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) >= 8.x.x\n- You are storing the customer's email address in the email field. Otherwise the emails won't work!\n- You are going to use one of Nodemailer's built in services.\n- You like to wear silly hats (optional).\n\n# Usage\n\n`git clone` this repo.\n\nEdit `public-config.js` to suit your needs and rename it to `config.js`.\n\n`lib/webhooks.js` is a list of the webhooks you support. If you don't want to do anything with a webhook, leave the function empty or just delete the entry completely. SWS\n\nYou might want to take a look if you prefer not to send out the default  at Maybe even edit `lib/webhook-server.js`.\n\nYou are good to go for local dev. See the `/scripts/` folder for setting this thing up on a VPS.\n\n# Modules in use\n\nFor your knowledge it's using these\n\n- [Express 3](http://expressjs.com)\n- [Nodemailer](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer) for sending email\n- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) for compiling templates\n\n# Bugs\n\nPlease branch, fix, and submit pull request. \n\n# Legal\n\nCopyright 2013 Jeff Parrish\n\nNo warranty expressed or implied.\n\nMIT License\n\n**NOT** officially affiliated with Stripe.\n\n",
